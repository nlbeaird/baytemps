Citizen Science: San Francisco Bay Temperatures at Aquatic Park, Q1 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Over the course of 1/17/2020 to 3/11/2020 (54 days) we collected 5205 
temperature data points, one every 15 minutes, from a remote logging 
device ~1 meter below the surface of the bay, near the entrance to 
aquatic park.

Over this period, the 

* Highest: 59.7
* Lowest: 51.8
* Average: 53.2

Methods 
~~~~~~~

We used the 
https://www.elitechustore.com/products/temtop-temlog20-pdf-waterproof-temperature-data-logger-usb-model-32000-points[Temtop 
Temlog 20] to record the temperatures.

Temlog 20"]

The logger was secured about a meter below the surface, near the 
entrance of Aquatic Park.  It moved up and down with the tides to stay 
at a constant level below the surface, and was able to move several 
meters side to side in the ebb and flood.

Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's prety cold out there.

Comparison to NOAA data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOAA collects data at a number of different locations 
https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/sfbofs/sfbofs_entrance.html[around 
the bay], the closest of which are "SW of AI" (Southwest of Alcatraz 
Island) and "North Point", which are both about a half mile from the 
collection location.

monitoring locations"]

Unfortunately, I can't find the raw data, but we can extrapolate from 
the graphs with recent data and forecasts.  The "SW of AI" location 
https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/sfbofs/model_graphics/SFBOFS_temp_swai_big.png[water 
temp graph] shows this graph on 3/12/2020:

of AI water temps graph"]

And the "North Point (Pier 41)" location 
https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/sfbofs/model_graphics/SFBOFS_temp_npp4_big.png[water 
temp graph] shows this graph on 3/12/2020:

Point water temps graph"]

The last data point collected at aquatic park was at 14:11:39 3/11/2020 
with a reading of 55.4F.  This time is almost exactly on the left-most 
point of these graphs, which I read as 54.0F and 54.2F respectively.

The ~1.3F degree difference may be explained by:

* The collector sensor being calibrated differently
* The collector being placed at a different location relative to the 
surface
* The collector being in a place that is genuinely warmer

Given that the two NOAA readings are quite similar, it makes sense that 
they are calibrated similarly.  I also imagine that their sensors are 
more expensive (e.g. more than $20) and accurate.  As they span either 
side of our collection point, it is unlikely that the water is overall 
warmer near Aquatic Park.

I would expect a reading at the surface to be warmer than a subsurface 
reading, and could imagine a difference on the order of a degree.  If 
the NOAA sensor are deeper than a meter, this could account for the 
difference.

So overall, it seems as though our sensor is reading may be ~1 degree 
higher than NOAA's readings.


Next Steps
~~~~~~~~~~

I'd like to

* Collect more data, and analyze the day-to-day variance across the year
* Better understand NOAA's collectors, to see if I can account for the 1 
degree difference
* Perhaps run two loggers side by side to control for calibration
* Get NOAA raw data to further compare
